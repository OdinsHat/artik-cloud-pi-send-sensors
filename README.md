# Samsung Artik Cloud

Samsung once ran a [cloud system](https://my.artik.cloud/) for receiving IoT sensor data and plotting it on graphs and creating dashboards. In May 2019 it shutdown so after procrastinating a while I finally got round to putting the sensor scripts up online for all.

The scripts are initially split into the systems they were sat on. The directory names are pretty self explanatory but if there needs to be more info a readme is provided in the directory.

## What is Samsung Artik

Before you get excited. [Its shuttered its services](https://my.artik.cloud/). Having said the the scripts provided here could give inspiration and help to anyone wanting to integrate into other services that have a similar functionality.
